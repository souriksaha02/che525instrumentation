# CHE 525 Instrumentation

We built a cabinet that contained control and power equipment for a coriolis flow meter, a pressure sensor, and a RTD.

These are the electrical equipment that was installed. It includes:
* A power supply that takes 110V down to 24V
* Breakers to mitigate issues if there is a surge in current
* The DeltaV control equipment

## Roles and Functions of the Equipment

* The coriolis flow meter is a device that has many functions. Its main purpose to measure the flowrate of a fluid. But, it can also measure the density, the temperature, and more. It measures the flow rate through the phenomenon known as the Coriolis effect. 
* The pressure sensor, as it's called, measures pressure using the deformation of a membrane (or diaphragm) under pressure, which is then converted into an electrical signal. 
* The RTD is able to measure the temperature of a fluid to a high degree of accuracy. They measure temperature by correlating the change in electrical resistance of a metal (usually platinum) with temperature, with a higher temperature resulting in higher resistance.
